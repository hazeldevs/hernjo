			<p> &emsp; &emsp; Mr. Herndon; Despite the countless counts of harassment between us, your classes have always been one of the most 
			entertaining to be a part of. Whether this manifests in you spraying me, forcing me to wash an orange, or simply terrorizing me in the
			clssroom, the experiences I have had in your classes during my time at Ridgeview will always be a fond memory of mine. Your teaching style,
			while not the best for tests (opinion light), is one of the most conducive to discussions that I've experienced. I hope to continue to 
			argue with my teachers and peers the same way you egged me on to throughout my time at RCS.</p>
